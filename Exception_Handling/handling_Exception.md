- Handling exceptions in a Flask RESTful API involves catching errors that occur during request processing and returning appropriate responses to the client. Here's a general approach to handle exceptions in a Flask RESTful API:

- Use Flask's error handling mechanism: Flask provides decorators such as @app.errorhandler to handle errors globally or @resource.error_handler to handle errors for specific resources. You can define functions to handle different types of exceptions.

- Custom Exceptions: Define custom exception classes for different types of errors that may occur in your API.

- Return Proper HTTP Status Codes: Ensure that your API returns proper HTTP status codes along with error messages in the response body to provide meaningful feedback to the client.
